# User Account Status Notification System

This system displays account approval/rejection notifications prominently on the main page (index.php) so users know their status immediately when they visit the site.

## üöÄ How It Works

### For Users
1. **After Registration**: Users register and wait for admin approval
2. **Status Check**: Users can check their status anytime via "Check Account Status" links
3. **Main Page Notifications**: When users visit the main page, they see prominent notifications about their account status
4. **Direct Access**: Users trying to log in with unapproved accounts are redirected to see their status

### For Admins  
1. **Approve/Reject**: Use the admin panel to approve or reject user accounts
2. **Automatic Notifications**: System automatically creates notifications for users
3. **Immediate Visibility**: Users see status updates on the main page without needing to log in

## üì± What Users See

### ‚úÖ **Approved Account**
- **Green success banner** at the top of the main page
- **"Login Now" button** that opens the login modal
- Congratulatory message welcoming them to the platform
- Notification automatically marked as read when viewed

### ‚ùå **Rejected Account**  
- **Yellow warning banner** at the top of the main page
- **"Check Status" button** linking to detailed status page
- Information about rejection and next steps
- Option to contact support or register a new account

## üîß Technical Implementation
