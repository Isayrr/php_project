PROBLEM: SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'a.applicant_id' in 'on clause'

ROOT CAUSE:
The SQL queries in several files were trying to reference 'a.applicant_id' as a column in the applications table, but the actual column name appears to be 'jobseeker_id'. This mismatch was causing the SQL errors.

FILES FIXED:

1. admin/applications.php
   - Changed all instances of 'a.applicant_id' to 'a.jobseeker_id' in the main query and the count query
   - Updated JOIN statements to reference the correct column name

2. admin/view-application.php
   - Changed all instances of 'a.applicant_id' to 'a.jobseeker_id' in the SQL query
   - Updated JOIN statements to reference the correct column name

3. admin/reports.php
   - Changed 'a.applicant_id' to 'a.jobseeker_id' in the JOIN statement

4. job-details.php
   - Changed 'applicant_id' to 'jobseeker_id' in both the SELECT query to check for existing applications
   - Updated the column name in the INSERT query to use 'jobseeker_id' instead of 'applicant_id'

SUMMARY:
There was a naming inconsistency in the database schema where the applications table uses 'jobseeker_id' to refer to the user who applied for a job, but some SQL queries were incorrectly using 'applicant_id'. The changes standardized all references to use 'jobseeker_id' to match the actual database schema.
