Problem: SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'type' in 'field list'

Root Cause:
The error occurred because some files in the admin directory were using 'type' as a column name in SQL queries to reference the job type, but the actual column name in the database is 'job_type'.

Files Updated:
1. admin/jobs.php
   - Changed references to 'j.type' to 'j.job_type' in SQL queries
   - Updated form field names from 'type' to 'job_type'
   - Updated UI references to match the correct column name

2. admin/add-job.php
   - Changed references to 'type' to 'job_type' in both PHP variables and SQL queries
   - Updated column names in the INSERT statement

3. admin/view-application.php
   - Updated the SQL query to use 'j.job_type' instead of 'j.type'

4. admin/applications.php
   - Updated the SQL query to use 'j.job_type' instead of 'j.type'

5. admin/reports.php
   - Updated the SQL query to use 'job_type' directly instead of 'job_type as type'
   - Updated chart data to use 'job_type' instead of 'type'

These changes ensure consistency throughout the application by using the correct column name 'job_type' from the jobs table in all SQL queries and form fields.
